// Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (orcompSame(a, b)) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it appears). "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.

// Examples
// Valid arrays
// a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  
// b = [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]


const summed = arr => arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

const comp = (arr1, arr2) =>
  arr1 && arr2 ? summed(arr1) === summed(arr2.map(x => Math.sqrt(x))) : false ;
